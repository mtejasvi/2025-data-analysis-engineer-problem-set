You are given a dataset that provides the number of active users per day per premium account. A premium account will have an entry for every day that itâ€™s premium. However, a premium account may be temporarily discounted and considered not paid, this is indicated by a value of 0 in the final_price column for a certain day. Find out how many premium accounts that are paid on any given day are still premium and paid 7 days later.
Output the date, the number of premium and paid accounts on that day, and the number of how many of these accounts are still premium and paid 7 days later. Since you are only given data for a 14 days period, only include the first 7 available dates in your output.

Table: premium_accounts_by_day

select a.entry_date,count(a.account_id) as premium_accntid,count(b.account_id) as premium_after7d
from premium_accounts_by_day a left join premium_accounts_by_day b on a.account_id=b.account_id and
DATEDIFF(DAY,a.entry_date,b.entry_date)=7 and b.final_price >0 where a.final_price>0 group by a.entry_date order by a.entry_date
