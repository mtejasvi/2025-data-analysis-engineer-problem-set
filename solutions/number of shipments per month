The unique key for one shipment is a combination of shipment_id and sub_id. Output the year_month in format YYYY-MM and the number of shipments in that month.

SELECT 
    FORMAT(shipment_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS year_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(shipment_id, '_', sub_id)) AS num_shipments
FROM 
    amazon_shipment
GROUP BY 
    FORMAT(shipment_date, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY 
    year_month;

output
year_month	num_shipments
